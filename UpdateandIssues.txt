 2)When the database is connected the message was not showing, fixed it by using Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) logic to ensure the script waits for the asynchronous connection before exiting.
 3) MongoDB Connection Error: querySrv ENOTFOUND _mongodb._tcp.357_ ( fixed by repasting the connection string from mongodb atlas)
 4)MongoDB Connection Error: bad auth : authentication failed (i was using @,which later replaced with %40 it worked) 
 5) Code was right but the connection was failed , which was due to the wrong api listing, which after set to 0.0.0.0 it got fixed .
 6) Issue arised because i wrote code in common js instead of ESM
 7)git push origin HEAD:feature/products ( use this if you commited in one branch and push it to the other desired branch)
